### Covid-19 Dashboard

I created a COVID-19 dashboard through Tableau to help me understand and visualise the global pandemic.

This repo contains the data preprocessing used by my Tableau dashboard, which can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alfred.zou#!/vizhome/COVID-19_15852011851070/COVID-19)

My commentary can be found [here.](https://alfredzou.github.io/portfolio/COVID-19/)
